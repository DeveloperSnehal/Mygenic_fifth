               <h2 class="section_header">Research Facilities</h2>
                <p>We have a team of over 500 skilled researchers working across our six research and development (R&D) centers in India and the USA. They contribute their expertise to develop various types of medicines, including generics, transdermal drug delivery systems, oral films, complex technology-based products, and Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS). We have dedicated teams for both process development and packaging development.</p>
                <p>To support our research endeavors, we have a capable Intellectual Property (IP) team. This team possesses strong expertise in chemistry, analytical techniques, dosage forms, and global patent law. Over the past 10 years, we have consistently challenged patents on valuable products in the US. This has allowed us to provide high-quality generic versions of those products at affordable prices. Our IP team remains vigilant in monitoring and protecting new developments within the company as intellectual property.</p>
                <p>Our R&D centers have successfully undergone audits and received approvals from international regulatory authorities. These authorities include the US FDA, European authorities, Australian authorities, and others. This demonstrates our commitment to maintaining high standards of quality and compliance in our research and development processes.</p>

               <h2 class="section_header">Achievements</h2>
                <p>At our Research and Development (R&D) Center, we have achieved significant milestones. We have successfully created and submitted over 150 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) to the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Additionally, we have developed nearly 70 products for TGA Australia (Therapeutic Goods Administration), around 40 products for the European Union (EU), and numerous dossiers for countries like Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Chile, and more worldwide.</p>
                <p>These achievements highlight our strong research capabilities and have brought us both business success and a reputation for delivering high-quality products. We are proud of our accomplishments and continue to strive for excellence in our research and development efforts.</p>
